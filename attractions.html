The cross is frequently visited by visitors and is housed in an octagonal pavilion composed of red tiles and adobe. It is situated close to the Basilica Minore Del Sto, in front of Cebu City Hall. Magellan inspired the name of Nino at Magallanes Street. On April 14, 1521, Magellan placed a wooden cross on the shores of Cebu to honor this significant occasion in the spread of the Roman Catholic faith in the Philippines. The cross has been referred to as the Magellan's Cross ever since. Take a Mybus to SM Cebu City if you're traveling from Mactan, and then take a jeepney with route code 10M or 12I. Request that you be dropped off at the Cebu Metropolitan Cathedral by your driver. Magellan's Cross can be reached on foot from there. For a more practical way to get to this location and other sites, you may also sign up for a guided tour.                              While at Magellan's Cross, what are your options?
                                 In the past, when they prayed, followers would place lit candles or drop monies at the foot of the cross. Since every candle has a symbolic value, each prayer is associated with a certain color.|https://maps.app.goo.gl/pDTeFvy1WFC4vUJ3A|imageat/nContact.png|Entrance Fee: Free">

Because it serves as a tomb for a great love that endures beyond death, many refer to the temple as the 'Taj Mahal of Cebu'. It has grown to be one of Cebu's most visited attractions in the past ten years.
                                 The Temple of Leah, which is situated in Barangay Busay, was built starting in 2012. The complex consists of about 24 distinct chambers, including a museum, a bar, an art gallery, and a library. As you investigate, you will also come across statues of gladiators, lions, and angels. A 10-foot-tall statue of Leah is located close to the lobby, and stone steps lead to the portico.

In addition, there are hyacinths and sunflowers in various areas for guests to see.
                                 Only a short distance from JY, Lahug, Cebu City, lies the hilltop where Sirao Flower Farm is located. To go to Sirao, you can take a habal-habal or a van.

Sirao Flower Farm is best seen during summer, which is from March to May. It’s best to avoid going to weekends as it gets crowded during those days.

You will be able to view the islands of Mactan and Bohol in the distance if the sky is clear. In addition, there is a chapel, gift store, library, garden, fountain, and wishing well within the temple complex. Take the 04L route in a jeep from Cebu City. On the route to Taoist Temple, ask the vehicle to leave you down on the road. After that, you can either take a guided tour with transfers or ride a habal-habal, which is the local term for a motorcycle for hire. Although Taoist Temple is open year-round, the best time to visit is from March to May, when Cebu is sunny.

The location represents the province's freedom and independence from its invaders. It was evident to those who came to the location today for relaxation, sightseeing, and photo ops. It is easily visible to all travelers because to its strategic location in downtown Cebu City, next to Fort San Pedro, Magellan's Cross, and the Cebu City Port. An obelisk honoring Spanish conqueror Miguel Lopez de Legazpi, who established the first Spanish settlement in Cebu in April 1565, stands in the center of the plaza. At the plaza, there is also a bronze statue of Ramon Magsaysay, the seventh president. Through its Veteran's Memorial monument, the Plaza Independencia also honors and remembers the bravery of every Filipino who served during World War II. Fort San Pedro, which is surrounded by Plaza Independencia, is another cultural landmark.
